# HR Hiring Management

This is a project for managing hiring processes. It's built with Next.js, React, and other technologies.

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JohnLoyd-Belen-primia-technical-exam-clientt.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```
    cd JohnLoyd-Belen-primia-technical-exam-client

    ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Approach

The project is structured around the concept of positions and candidates. Positions are created and managed through a form interface, and candidates can be associated with these positions. The project uses React for the frontend, with Next.js for server-side rendering, and axios for making HTTP requests.

## Design Decisions

The project uses a modular design, with each component in its own file. This makes the code easier to maintain and test. The state of the application is managed using React's useState and useEffect hooks, which allows for a functional programming style and makes the state easier to reason about.

## Future Improvements

With more time, I would implement the following features:

- User authentication: This will make the security stronger.
- More detailed candidate and position information: This could include things like a resume, a profile picture, and a rating system.
- Filter functionality: This would allow users to filter for positions or candidates.
